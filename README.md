Toad Trunk or Treat

We are going to automate a bean bag toss game so that:
  - It has 6 doors.
  - Doors will be randomized so that 4 doors deliver candy and 2 doors deliver water.
  - If 2 water doors are opened the next door will be candy.
  - If 2 candy doors are opened the next door will be water.
  - Play a sound effect for each type of door.

Stretch goal is a web interface for:
  - Reseting the sensors for a new person
  - Making all doors shoot candy for the little kids.
  - Making all doors shoot water for kids that keep coming back.
  - Lock-out to stop all candy and water activities.

This toad house originally debuted at the Pinewood Preparatory School Trunk or Treat
in Oct 2014.  That version had 2 doors which where wired directly to the candy cannons
(picture and diagram included).  It was a pretty simple game and the kids learned which
doors would give candy.  Some of the older kids also learned that if they stood in the
right spot they could catch candy from the smaller kids which had to stand closer to
the game.

We are back in 2015 with this new and improved version!  Complete with automation and
hopefully some metrics around candy vs water.
